    <h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>The US has one of the highest murder rates among developed countries, with 5.2 out of every 100,000 Americans being murder victims between 2010 - 2012. What are the factors that lead to the US having such a high murder rate? Politicians point to gun control, the unemployment rate, racial tensions, and dozens of other demographic pieces of information. Our motivation is to separate the trends from the noise, and find the factors that really contribute to a high murder rate. Additionally, our model should effectively predict the murder rates of a given area. With this information, administrators should be able to pinpoint which areas may have higher murder rates and form effective policies in response.</p>
<h3 id="literature-review">Literature Review</h3>
<p>There have been multiple studies done in the past on the topic of homicides in the US. However, as far as we are concerned, this is the first study done on MSA level data. The 2 most significant pieces of literature we reviewed are “Making Your State Safer: Factors Influencing Interstate Homicide Rates in the United States” <sup><a href="#asu">1</a></sup> by Tanya Watt and Chung-Chen Lee, and “The Relationship Between Gun Ownership and Firearm Homicide Rates in the United States, 1981–2010” <sup><a href="#nih">2</a></sup> by Michael Siegal, Craig S. Ross, and Charles King III.</p>
<p>The first paper examines state level data from 2005 to determine factors influencing homocide rates. Watt and Lee find that education levels (-), % percentage of population that is African American (+), and the existence of large cities (+) were all statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01). They also found that unemployment and income were not statistically significant predictors. Their model produced an adjusted R-squared of 0.69. This regression analysis was only performed on data from 2005, and at a state level, so we believe our analysis to be more robust in consideration.</p>
<p>The second paper examines the relationship between gun ownership and firearm homicide rates. We
were inspired to look at this paper after reading the Watt and Lee paper, given their analysis also includes the Brady Campaign Report Card (this was found to not be statistically significant). The Brady Campaign Report Card is a score card published every year, giving each state a grade on how effective their gun control laws are. No single dataset on US gun ownership exists, so Siegal et al use a proxy: percentage of firearm related suicides relative to overall suicides. This paper finds that gun ownership is a significant predictor of firearm homicide rates, with firearm homicides increasing by 0.9% for every percentage point increase in gun ownership. The dataset they used to proxy gun ownership is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Web-Based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting Systems database. Unfortunately, the data can only be accessed and downloaded through a complicated web-app that made it very difficult to scrape. For future work, we would love to include this dataset in our model. Given this paper only focuses on firearm homicides, we believe our model is more expansive and more detailed.</p>
